# Unciv-WWII
Hello. Here's my first mod based on WWII and above. It's not 100% historical accurate but 100% fun ;)
This mod includes 8 differents countries who participate to WWII, more than 150 units (soldier, tank, plane, ship)...
Every contry has his own units. It also includes a lot of buildings to grow you civilization. The tech tree is completly new. Branches are separted by type : 
Army, Economy, Agriculture, Defence, Production, Culture, Science and Happiness.
The mod is still under building. Please be kind. I will keep it uptaded but i need time. Thanks to people who help me.
